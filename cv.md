**About Myself:**

*I live in Zaporizhia city in Ukraine, but now i'm in Germany, I hope it won't be long... Befor war I worked as a system administrator assistant in a budget organization. I was engaged in setting up computer equipment, installing software on it, supporting software, and also a little bit of everything from entering a formula in an Excel cell to setting up printing to a printer via Wi-Fi or changing a hard drive or network card in a computer.* 
  
*I want to change profession and become a developer, as I believe that work should "give a sense of moral satisfaction" and open up prospects for personal and career growth. And given the current situation in Ukraine, I assume that as a developer I have a better chance of finding a job, even taking into account the fact that I have no experience and I am far from 25 years old.*
